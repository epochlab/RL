#### Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: *Reinforcement learning is the field of computer science concerned with how agents, through trial and error, learn to operate within an environment in order to maximize a reward signal.*

### Packages

`gym` `vizdoom` `tensorflow-2.x` `numpy` `imageio`

### Environments

- OpenAI Gym
- vizDOOM

### Requirements
- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation.

#### Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: *Reinforcement learning is the field of computer science concerned with how agents, through trial and error, learn to operate within an environment in order to maximize a reward signal.*

### Build
- Deep Q-Network: DQN, DoubleDQN, DeulingDQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, Fixed & Soft Targets.
- Policy Gradient: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C).
- Vizualisation: Engine Buffers, Attention Window, Neural Heatmap, Q-Score, Confidence Plot.

### Packages
`gym` `vizdoom` `tensorflow-2.x` `numpy` `imageio` `matplotlib`

### Environments
- OpenAI Gym
- VizDOOM

### Requirements
- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation.

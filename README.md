#### Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: *Reinforcement learning is the field of computer science concerned with how agents, through trial and error, learn to operate within an environment in order to maximize a reward signal.*

### Build
- Deep Q-Network: DQN | DoubleDQN | DuelingDQN | Prioritized Experience Replay | Fixed & Soft Targets
- Policy Gradient: REINFORCE | Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
- Vizualisation: Saliency Map | Attention Window | Q-Confidence Plot | Engine Buffers
- Development: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) | Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
